Report on the website
After careful consideration, the main theme I choose for the website is about a web that sales pet. First I do the setup of the main code of the web along with the source and link code for the Bootstraps. I choose the main color for this website will be white and beige. First I create the navbar and colored it beige, along with the navigation button for the categories. I create the navigation button with the categories slide down when clicked on it. It kinda challenges when creating the button because I find it hard to link with the list. Next I create the hero section. I use the jumbotron class and container to create it with 2 sentences and a background image. Then I create a services section with container and grid to layout the service on my web below the hero section than style it. Then I use container, grid and cards to create a gallery section with the content is 3 best seller animals in the store. Then I use form class to create a form for the viewer to type in their name, email address and feedback and then style it simple with css. Then lastly I use the card and the icon to create the footer. I style this webpage kinda base on the Chelsea FC webpage.
